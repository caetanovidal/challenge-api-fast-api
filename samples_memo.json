The same amount of\\nbitterness belongs to the tobacco taste. Burning is defined\\nas an analogous feeling as a pepper taste and differs from\\nthe strength feeling which is related to the nicotine\\nconcentration. ~\\n\\nThe physiological strength of tobacco smoke depends on\\nthe nicotine and it is not included into a taste definition.\\nFullness is defined as a total feeling in the mouth. Tobacco\\naroma is a specific tobacco smell (skeletal tobacco has no\\naroma).\\n\\n7 Aroma of smoke is defined as a specific smell of .\\ntobacco smoke, The astringent-sour taste is related to ray\\nthe definition of tongue coating.

Whitley and Lorillard Vice\\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer Dr. Alexander W. Spears.\\nPress attendance at the briefing and at the hearing was heavy.\\nABC-TV, CBS-TV, NSC-TV, CNN-TV, and several satellite news\\ncameras covered the events.

Clyburn asked the subcommittee to consider the timing of the\\nFebruary 25 letter from FDA Commissioner Kessler and noted that\\nhe and his constituents take exception to such *scare-monger ing.”\\nRep. Lancaster stated that Commissioner Kessler had his “pistol N\\nhalf-cocked and loaded with blanks\" in writing the February 25 oO\\nletter. He noted that using the Commissioner‘s logic, the FDA N\\nshould be regulating wine, beer and distilled spirits. He said had\\nthat the FDA was unable “to meet its current mandate\" and should o\\nnot be burdened with additional responsibilities. N\\na\\nW\\nN\\n",

Takasugi\\nRE Merit Maxi Campaign\\nThis memo summarizes our point of view regarding the\\nrecently developed Merit \"Maxi\" campaign, as described in\\nthe attached documents.\\n)\\nMerit in Europe\\nIt seems to me that the \"Maxi\" campaign was developed in the\\ncontext of Merit's current market position in Italy,\\nSwitzerland, France and other European countries. The\\n“Pormula 1 of the Sea\" concept is, in my view, a logical and\\nappropriate extension of the currant promction-driven brand\\ncommunication in Italy for several reasons.\\nPirst, it builds on an existing sailing-related brand image\\nand focuses on the specialized area of maxi yachts, the\\n“Pormala 1 of the Sea\". Given the tremendous popularity and\\nunderstanding, and extensive media coverage of competitive\\nsailing in Europe, this campaign associates Merit with the\\n@imension cf sailing that most spectators are interested in;\\nthe high action, technology, challenge and risk.\\n\\na Second, in the context of the legal media and creative\\nrestrictions in several Burepean markets, this campaign\\nseems to work best without light-up and smoking shots; high\\naction and smoking are often nct compatible.\\n\\nThirdly, through its high energy/high action execution, the\\ncampaign comminicates \"flavor\", rather than lightness.\\nAssuming that Merit already has a firm reputation as a low\\ntar brand, this change in communication may widen the\\nbrand's appeal, especially among younger male smokers.\\nnN\\nwn\\nS\\n-1- S\\n=\\n=\\na\\nDp\\n@\\n",

Gardner\\nSUBJECT: Application No. 973A\\n\\nRonald E, Rasmussen, Ph.d., University of California, Irvine, Cali?.\\n\\n\"A Genetic Study of DNA Repair in Inbred Strains of Mice”.\\n\\nThis is essentially a basic approach to the possible inheritance\\nof the capacity to repair DNA in mice. It is know that such differences\\ndo exist in wan. The assumption 1s that faulty DNA repair may lead to\\ncarcinogenesis, induced by chesicals, ionizing or u.¥. irradiations, etc.\\nExcision and repair of DIMA that has been dameged can now be quantitated\\nby permitting cnly the synthesis of the repair DNA by tho aédition of\\nhydroxyurea to the cultyres thet have been exposed to U.V. or aikylating\\nagents, The uptake of ~N thymodine gives quantitation of the excision and\\neubsecuent repair, Radicautographic tethods can also be used for both\\nrepair and replicative DNA synthesis.\\n\\nLung tissue from 7 contrasting streins of mice will be exposed\\nin vitro to the alkylating agent, 4-nitroquinolone oxide (4NGO), and\\nchecked fer Gifferences in damnge and repair. Other chemicals thet result\\n\\nO in other types of DNA damage that uay be repatred will also be used to\\ndetect possiple strain differences lu repair potentiality. It has been\\nehown that labeled PAHs are bound in nuclei and that they stay there for\\nseme time, The cellular localization after IT instillation of BaB will\\nbe followed in mice of the several strains. These experiments will be\\ndone in collaboration with Dr. Kouri,® Projected studies for the subse-\\nquect years will depend upon the results of the first year.\\n\\nThe budget, which supports + salary for the applicant and $ that\\nof two research associates, seems reasonable. The refrigereted centrifuge\\n\\n. requested would seem essential for this work.\\nAlthough the applicant has other research grants and others\\npending his study of the effects of sncke and CSC, he should be gupported.\\nWULG.\\nwos/eah\\n_ ~*~ 86709275\\n",
