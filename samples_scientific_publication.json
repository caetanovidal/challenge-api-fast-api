All cases of sudden death in white women\\naged 25-64 years who died outside the hospital within 24 hours of onset of\\nsymptoms were ascertained. The overall autopsy rate was 63%. Detailed\\npost-mortem examinations were conducted on 42 of 80 sudden cardiac cases.\\nCases were more often heavy smokers and had fewer children than the control\\npopulation. Fifteen out of 80 women who died suddenly of heart disease\\nand three controls had a definite history of psychiatric disease. Cases\\nhad more often experienced the death of a significant other within six -\\nmonths prior to their demise. Multiple regression analysis showed that [on]\\ncigarette smoking, psychiatric history and death of a significant other o\\ncontributed significantly to differences between women who died suddenly i]\\nand contro] women. Thirteen women died suddenly under the age of 45 years. eg)\\nSix of the 13 deaths were due to arteriosclerotic heart disease, These 2\\nsix women were all smokers, and four were currently taking oral contra- S\\nC ceptives or estrogen replacements.... aj\\nron)\\n",
