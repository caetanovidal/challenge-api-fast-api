The groups were conducted |\\n. in Cincinnati on April 12 and 13. :\\nfo\\nBackground\\nThe focus groups were conducted to gain a qualitative reaction to\\ncigarette ideas directed at social problems connected with smoking,\\nThe bulk of the discussion centered on four ideas:\\n1. A cigarette with no sidestream smoke.\\n2. A cigarette with 50% less sidestream smoke,\\n3. A cigarette with a pleasant aroma.\\na 4. A cigarette which did not stain teeth or fingers.\\nSummary of Results\\n1. Smokers will not accept any modification in their cigarette\\nos . which would adversely affect its taste. There seems to be a\\n“ predisposition that any changes in a cigarette tend to adversely\\naffect the taste - perhaps a result of experience with low tar\\ncigarettes,\\n2. Smokers do feel that sidestream (or “raw\") smoke can be bother-\\nsome to both non-smokers and smokers due to the odor and irritation.\\nHowever, they did indicate that the smoke does have some\\npsychological benefits (the aroma, the visual pleasure of\\nwatching the smoke, a feeling of comfort). Smokers were very\\nskeptical that a cigarette like this could deliver much taste.\\n3. A cigarette which gave off 50% (or noticeably) less smoke seemed\\nto be a reasonable compromise to many of the panel members, The\\npsychological benefits are retained, but there is less smoke to’\\ncollect in a house, gather on clothes, etc. However, most\\nmembers agreed that non-smokers would remain dissatisfied as\\nlong as a cigarette gave off any smoke.\\n3\\nE\\n2\\n~\\nrr\\n°\\nw\\n",

The concentration and impact of our overall identifi-\\ncation and the young adult male orientation of this growing sport\\nare factors which make this a unique activity.\\nAs we move toward our planning for next year, the following observa—\\ntions should be noted:\\ni. Improvewents are needed in two key areas relating to sampling\\nand promotional products: (a) The unique, open accessibility\\nand spectator traffic flow make sampling more difficult,\\n(b) The strong orientation of this group to t-shirts and the\\nactive merchandising by the various racing sponsor/concessionaires\\nplaces our Promotional Products Group approach ar a competitive\\ndisadvantage.\\nRecommendation/Action Program\\nDiscussions with R. Powell and J. Byrd have generated a variety\\nof ideas for testing to address current needs. The focal point\\nof the test effort would be a tent and activity area which would\\nserve as a sampling distribution point, a display area estab-\\nlishing brand sponsorship to smokers, and a opportunity for\\nbroader, aote aggressive merchandising of our Promotional Pro-\\nducts Group items. In effect, a grouping of current low level\\nactivities into a more concentrated area, positioned to maximize\\ntraffic flow, would heighten our brand presence at the event.\\n(This is not too unlike the VANTAGE PGA tent which is designed .\\nfor a similar sampling objective.)\\nProposed testing of this activity area, accompanied by other\\nproven volume oriented and consumer involvement activities, will\\n{ help provide a much needed promotional focus to drag racing. Ie\\n. is proposed that the test of this program would be scheduled for\\nLabor Day weekend at Indfanapolis. Funding would be provided by S\\nPromotion/Promotional Products Group test dollars with ultimate x\\nrv) funding for this effort from Sampling and Promotional Products 0\\nead Group budgets. nN\\nwe .\\nread ©\\nae\\n",

The purpose of the test was to assess whether heavier presence had an impact on\\nmarkel sales. The test included fiighted OOH, continuous print, and multiple visuals, and\\nthe spending rate was al about double the national level.\\nWith the 1994 budget squeeze, national advertising spending was reduced as was\\nMinneapolis, however, the test arca continued to receive support at about double the\\nnational tate. Also in April 1994, the Camel BU began a heavy retail plan that\\nencompassed five regions and included Minneapolis\\nMethodology\\nWe attempted to evaluate this test using traditional methods during 1993 (report issued\\n3/14/94 covering August-December 1993). Results from this early read indicated no\\nnoticeable impact on sales. With Minneapolis becoming & retail heavy-up market in 1994\\nanda shifi in level of advertising support, this approach did not work for subsequent time\\nperiods.\\nWe approached IRI about doing a modeled technique, but based on their cost estimate of\\n$45,000 we elected not to go with them. Instead, we utilized internal resources and Don\\nSchmidt in the BIAD Decision Support group developed the analytical approaches to\\nassess this issue.\\nThree analytical approaches were utilized: simple irend, forecasted bascline, and a\\nmodeled covariate procedure. The more sophisticated techniques provide @ way to try to\\nseparate out the effects of media from the other market effects that were going on at the\\nlime, particularly pricing and promotion. All three approaches led to the same overall\\nconclusion.\\nw\\nwe\\n=\\nia\\na\\n: o\\nry\\nm\\nN\\n",
