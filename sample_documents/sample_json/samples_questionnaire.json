    "text": "DR. YELMUT WAXEHAM\\nt. Could you please provide me with a brief biographical sketch of\\nyour educational and professional background before joining Philip “or-\\nris? why did you coze to FM and what was the general state of the\\nresearch and development program at that time?\\n2. To what extent were you familiar with the scientific literature\\non the poasidle consequences of smoking that waa relied upon by the\\nSurgeon Seneral's Advisory Committee in preparing its 1964 report?\\nanich aspects of that gathering body of literature -~- if any -- caused\\nyou and your colleegues in R&D the greatest concern? How wag that\\nconcern registered to upper management, if in fact it was, and how\\nreceptive generally to these concerns wag Pid management?\\n3. In an October 24, 196}, memorandum to Mr, Cullman et al., you\\nspeculated that the totacco industry might face greater trouble from\\ncharges that smoking was a major contributor to chronic obstructive\\njung disease than from any other health problem. To what extent do\\nyou feel PM waa responsive cver the years to this potential protlem\\nand how have the company's products been modified to meet this possible\\ncharge?\\n4. A little more than a month before the '64 Surgeon Generals Ad-\\nvisory Committee report, an intramural memorandum regarding “Project\\nOLCO” listed as a prise goal for 1964 development of a “‘medically\\nacceptable’ cigarette ‘tn light of the present health attitude” and\\nadded that special emphasis ought now to be placed by the smoke chem-\\nistry group on the reacval of polynuclear hydrocarbons and selective\\nfiltration of the potentially problematic nitrosamines even as both\\nnicotine and phenocla had been substantially reduced by research. To\\nwhat extent do you feel this goal was pursued in ensuing years and\\nhave FM'a product? been modified over the past twenty-five yearg in\\nways not acknowledged by “the present health attitude” of 19897\\nS. The FU Research Center composed a memorandum dated February 18,\\n1908, on the significance of the Surgeon General’9 report of tne pre-\\nvioug month. I have a few questions in connection with thig memor\\n\\n(a) Did tt essentially reflect your views?\\n\\n(b) One of the cemo's malin objections to the SG's report was its\\nalmost total omigeton of evidence on the “possible ameliorating ef-\\nfect of fliters\"-\"nich, after all, had become the dominant type of\\nCigarette by that time. Did you feel at that time that there was\\nreason to be hopeful tnat such anellorating effects might in fact be av\\nrealized by product modifications? Have they, in your opinion, In o\\nfact been realized? (In asking this, I appreciate that the company’s nN\\nlegal advisors may well conclude that any positive answer to this i]\\nquestion might constitute a “health claim” that thay say is not per- Pw\\nmitted under the rules of the PTC. I have registered with them my x\\npuzzlement over Such a view and said that I am unable to find any @\\nbasis -- nor have I encountered anyone outside the tobacco industry\\nwno hag -- for the conclusion that “health claims” cannot be made even MF\\nSf they are based on scientific evidence. It is against unfounded [*)\\nhealth claims that sucn FTC rules are directed, as I understand it.)\\n\\n4 “ unde\\ni\\n",
